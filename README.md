ZeroEGGS retarget
=================

This is version of the [Ubisoft La Forge ZeroEGGS Animation Dataset](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-ZeroEGGS) exported in both fbx and bvh format with a different skinned character applied. The data is slightly adjusted - the character has been translated down vertically so that the feet touch the floor on the provided skinned character.

The skinned character mesh is available in `Geno.fbx` and is free for non-commercial research use.

This dataset is compatible with:

* [lafan1-resolved](https://github.com/orangeduck/lafan1-resolved)
* [motorica-retarget](https://github.com/orangeduck/motorica-retarget)
